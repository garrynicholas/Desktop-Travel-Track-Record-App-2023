# Desktop Travel Track Record App 2023
This project is a Desktop Travel Track Record App developed using Java in 2023 during my third year of high school. The application allows users to create and manage travel records with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Additionally, it integrates Google Maps using JxBrowser to choose locations, though this feature is still in progress.
